        <b>The Smiths</b> were an English rock band formed
        in Manchester in 1982. The band consisted of 
        vocalist Morrissey, guitarist Johnny Marr, 
        bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce.
        Critics have called them the most important 
        alternative rock band to emerge from 
        the British independent music scene of the 
        1980s.

        The band picked their name in part as a 
        reaction against those used by synthpop bands 
        of the early 1980s, such as Orchestral Manoeuvres
        in the Dark and Spandau Ballet, which they 
        considered pretentious. In a 1984 interview 
        Morrissey said that he chose The Smiths 
        "because it was the most ordinary name" 
        and because he thought that it was "time 
        that the ordinary folk of the world showed their 
        faces."

        Their catalog is crammed with astonishing songs (and very, very few duds) 
        and while their records cleverly cherry-picked from the past, they were like no records 
        that had ever been made before. The music was terrifically concise, but somehow 
        simultaneously fierce and delicate, and Johnny Marr's guitar lines threw off melodies
        in every direction, as though he had so many at his fingertips that he could never
        run short. And as for those lyrics—thoughtful, poetic, brusque, funny, oblique, and
        heartfelt—each delivered with a kind of swooning, delirious over-committal…it was 
        as though someone had just discovered a higher standard for what a pop song should be,
        and only the Smiths had been told. Theirs was a rare magic, and they clearly knew it
